### interesting flavors

- (*) [Reforth](https://github.com/seanpringle/reforth) "Reforth tries to solve my gripes without fundamentally changing Forth's elegance and simplicity ... Many of these have been solved in other Forths and certainly none are new ideas. But, for whatever reason, I havn't found them all together in one place."
- [wasm-forth](https://github.com/stefano/wasm-forth) b/c wasm is the future
- [J1](https://excamera.com/sphinx/fpga-j1.html) "is a small (200 lines of Verilog) stack-based CPU, intended for FPGAs. A complete J1 with 16Kbytes of RAM fits easily on a small Xilinx FPGA"
- [ficl](http://ficl.sourceforge.net/), embeddable ticl-like forth
- [min](https://min-lang.org/) "A small but practical concatenative programming language and shell"
- [XY](http://nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm), very clean semantics, some good ideas to consider for universal IR. Bonus, implemented in K
- [Mirth](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth) PL theory heavyweight. Interesting tag system for effectful code
- [sporth](https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/sporth) for audio
- [runt](https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/runt) tiny, ansi C, plugins, practical
